## Quick start

1. Install the **Inventory** extension in LNbits and add your products
2. Install **Telegram Shopping**
3. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) - copy the token
4. Create a shop in the extension: paste the token, follow the setup
5. Toggle the shop on! Then your bot goes live

> Use **polling** mode for development (no public URL needed). Consider switch to **webhook** for production.

## Bot commands

The bot registers a single command. All customer interaction happens in the Mini App.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Welcome message with an "Open Shop" button that launches the Mini App |

## Deep links

Link directly to a product — the "Open Shop" button opens the Mini App on that product's page:

```
https://t.me/yourbotname?start=product_PRODUCT_ID
```

Use these for QR codes at events, social media posts, pinned group messages, or anywhere you want one-tap access to a specific product.

## Inline mode

Customers can share products in any Telegram chat. Type `@yourbotname` followed by a search term — the bot suggests matching products as rich inline results with images and prices. Tapping a result posts it into the chat with an "Open Shop" button.

```
@yourbotname pizza
```

Great for word-of-mouth: customers share products with friends without leaving their current conversation.

## Configuration

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Checkout mode** | `none` · `email` · `address` |
| **Currency** | `sat` or any fiat code (`USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, ...) |
