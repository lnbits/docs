<br>

This extension behaves like the standard BitcoinSwitch extension with the following changes:

**(1)** Payments available during specified time window. This allows to create a device (for animal feeding or whatever you want to activate) with opening hours so that it is only accessible during a specific time window.

**(2)** Timeout after each payment. After each succesful payment, the device is blocked for some time. This to prevent overfeeding or triggering when feeding is active.

**(3)** When making a payment is not allowed, an alternative image is displayed instead of a QR code. The LNURL payment flow also returns an error when trying to make a payment outside opening hours.

**(4)** Removed support for devices other that bitcoinSwitch
